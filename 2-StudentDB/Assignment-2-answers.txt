1. Yes, I think it was a good idea, because it improves the code's reusability. Allowing multiple functions to query student data consistently without any reduntant or unnecessary code.

2. This could be problematic because local variables are stored on the stack, and their memory is deallocated when the function exits. The pointer could reference invalid memory
which could lead to undefined behavior.

3. This implementation works because malloc() allocates memory on the heap, which persists after the function returns. However, it could include some potential memory leaks if not
handled correctly.

4. The file size reported by ls increased because each student record occupies a specific byte offset based on the ID. When a student with a higher ID number is added, the file needs
to grow to accommodate for that offeset, even if the records are empty. However, du reports the actual disk usage which remains small because Linux supports sparse files.

5. The disk storage remained at 4K because the file size was within a single filesystem block. Sparse files do not allocate disk blocks for empty data regions. So when the file size
exceeds 4K after adding student ID 64, a second block was created, increasing the disk usage to 8K

6. The file size increased to 6400000 because the record for student ID 99999 is located at a large byte offset. But, since linux does not allocate disk space for empty regions, the
actual storage used only increased by one more block which brought the total to 12K.
